Description:
This project first generates a mapdata text file which can be uploaded to the Arduino's SD card which will enable it to procedurally generate a unique map. The user can then navigate the map using a joystick on the arduino and explore the given map. The goal is for the user to find a red box which symbolizes the end goal. If the user is unable to find the box, they may touch the solve button on the screen which will
draw a path to the box for the user, on the console it will then display the time it took to run dijkstras for each implementation. The goal of the project is to show the differences in running time through different search algorithmns and using different min-heaps.

Notes and Assumptions:
The program assumes that the user has access to eClass, some of the functions used within the project were not written by us and therefore all credit is given to the authors on eClass. This is indicated on the files with "!" in the included files list.
